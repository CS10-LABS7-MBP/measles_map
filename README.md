# Exploring infections through data: Interactive visualisation of Measles in theÂ USA

Welcome to my project exploring interactive data visualisation in Python using Measles data from Project Tycho. The original dataset can be found on Kaggle here https://www.kaggle.com/pitt/contagious-diseases/home

Please find a conda enviroment file for all dependancies for this project. The project contains four parts:
* Exploring measles with interactive plots - this is the main project notebook
* Pandas Tutorial - a simple tutorial on Pandas that explains how I performed some of the data wrangling
* Bokeh Tutorial - an overview of some of the basic concepts of Bokeh that I used
* Dashboard application - the full bokeh python app that can be hosted locally using Bokeh Server

Dashboard application is also hosted remotely here - https://measles-bokeh.herokuapp.com/main
